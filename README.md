# Air-Quality-App

## Air Quality Application made with PHP

Fictitious application displaying information about air quality in a given area.
Created with PHP as part of my preparation for the "Fullstack Web & Mobile Application Developer" professional qualification.

## Setup

This site uses PHP, Composer and Sass.
It is therefore necessary to compile the SCSS code by running:

```bash

sass custom.scss custom.css

```

In the root project folder, in order to obtain CSS code that can be understood by the browser.

---

You also need Composer on your server and run

```bash

composer install

```

In the root project folder to install some dependencies.
Finally, you need a web server (such as Apache or NGNINX) with PHP (min. 8.2.^) to run this application.
